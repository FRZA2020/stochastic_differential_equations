# stochastic_differential_equations


the R script is an implementation of the implicit Euler method for a linear 2 dimensional differential equation. 
It uses the sde package for simulation a Brownian motion.
The method is described in: P. Kloeden, Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations (Chapter 12)
